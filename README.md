# Kevin's Magic 8-Ball 
When I was in middle school, I created a basic Magic 8-Ball program on my TI-81 calculator. I always got a kick out of that very basic program on the calculator and wanted to try it again using Python! This is a very basic program that you can run to ask questions for some pretty basic, and sarcastic answers. These are random answers just like a Magic 8-Ball!
